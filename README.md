Hi, Iâ€™m Anastasiia, a junior Full Stack Web Developer based in Canada. This portfolio presents my work as a web developer and reflects my passion for building modern, user-centered websites.
With a passion for clean code, responsive design, and user-friendly experiences, I aim to create websites and applications that are both functional and meaningful. In 2025, I completed the Full Stack Web Development program at Robertson College, where I gained hands-on experience building real-world projects.
